# MERN DevOps Project

This project is designed to facilitate the deployment of a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) application by integrating key DevOps tools and best practices. It leverages Docker for containerization, Kubernetes for orchestration, Jenkins for CI/CD automation, Helm for package management, ArgoCD for GitOps-based deployment, Kustomize for environment-specific configurations, and Prometheus/Grafana for monitoring and observability.

---

## Overview

The MERN DevOps project includes:

- **Dockerization**: Building and running containers for the frontend, backend, and MongoDB using Docker and Docker Compose.

- **Kubernetes Deployment**: Deploying the application on a kind Kubernetes cluster and configuring an ingress controller.

- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automating multiple SDLC stages using Jenkins.

- **Helm Deployment**: Managing Kubernetes deployments using Helm charts for MongoDB, backend, and frontend services.

- **ArgoCD GitOps**: Continuously deploying and synchronizing the application with the GitHub repository.

- **Kustomize**: Managing Kubernetes configurations for different environments without modifying base YAML files.

- **Observability**: Implementing monitoring mechanisms using tools like Prometheus and Grafana to monitor the health and performance of the application.
