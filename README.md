# MERN DevOps Project

This project is designed to facilitate the  deployment of a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) application. By leveraging modern technologies such as Docker for containerization, Kubernetes for orchestration, and Jenkins for continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD), this project aims to streamline the entire software development lifecycle.

## Overview

The MERN DevOps project includes:

- **Dockerization**: Building and running containers for the frontend, backend, and MongoDB using Docker.
- **Kubernetes Deployment**: Deploying the application on a Kubernetes cluster using `kubectl` and YAML configurations.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automating the build, test, and deployment processes using Jenkins.
